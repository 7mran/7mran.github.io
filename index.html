      <p class="section-text">
         I'm a passionate Computer Science student with a deep interest in data science and artificial intelligence. Currently in my final year at City, University of London, I'm constantly exploring new technologies and pushing the boundaries of what's possible with code. In my spare time, I enjoy creating code to automate tasks and build tools that enhance user experiences because I believe technology should empower people, not complicate their lives. With technology evolving at a quicker pace than ever before, now is the perfect time to help shape how these powerful tools integrate seamlessly into everyday life.

                     <h2>2024/25 Season Analysis - Key Insights for 2025/26 Strategy</h2>
                     
                     <p>Analysis of the completed 2024/25 Fantasy Premier League season reveals groundbreaking performances and strategic insights that will be crucial for managers planning their 2025/26 campaigns. This comprehensive review highlights record-breaking achievements, emerging patterns, and tactical considerations based on the season's statistical data.</p>
                     
                     <h2>Record-Breaking Performances</h2>
                     
                     <p>Mohamed Salah delivered the most dominant individual FPL performance in history, shattering all previous records with an extraordinary 344 points, breaking the previous record by 41 points. The Liverpool midfielder achieved 29 goals and 18 assists, marking his best ever season at the club, while setting a new record for bonus points with 55, receiving maximum bonus points on 11 occasions across 21 matches.</p>
                     
                     <p>Salah's dominance was so complete that he scored 126 points more than his closest competitor, Cole Palmer, who himself had an impressive campaign. Bryan Mbeumo emerged as the second-highest scorer with 236 points, while Palmer managed 214 points, demonstrating the significant gap between Salah and the rest of the field.</p>
                     
                     <h2>Key Performance Indicators</h2>
                     
                     <p>Salah's consistency was unmatched, scoring four or more points in 74% of the games he featured in, with most points coming from attacking contributions. In comparison, Cole Palmer achieved four or more points in 44% of Premier League matches, still representing excellent reliability for a creative midfielder.</p>
                     
                     <p>The season demonstrated the continued importance of penalty-taking midfielders and forwards, with Salah's penalty responsibilities contributing significantly to his record-breaking total alongside his natural goal-scoring and creative abilities.</p>
                     
                     <h2>Strategic Implications for 2025/26</h2>
                     
                     <p><strong>Premium Asset Strategy:</strong> Salah's record-breaking season reinforces the importance of securing the most dominant players regardless of cost. His 344-point total validates strategies built around one or two premium assets, as the point differential at the top level proved decisive for overall rankings.</p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Consistency vs Explosiveness:</strong> The gap between Salah and Palmer highlights the value of consistent performers over purely explosive players. While Palmer remained excellent, Salah's week-to-week reliability proved more valuable over a full season.</p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Goalkeeper Investment:</strong> Pickford's consecutive top-scoring seasons among goalkeepers suggests that investing in premium goalkeepers from defensively organised teams can provide significant advantages, particularly those with penalty-saving capabilities.</p>
                     
                     <p><strong>Bonus Point Maximization:</strong> Salah's record 55 bonus points demonstrate the importance of players who consistently contribute to multiple statistical categories. Players with high shot volume, key passes, and goal involvement tend to accumulate bonus points more effectively.</p>

                     <h2>Fraud Detection Analysis Report</h2>
                  <p>This report presents findings from a comprehensive analysis of potential mule accounts across a dataset of 1,000 bank accounts. The analysis identified 59 accounts flagged as potential mule accounts, representing a 5.9% fraud rate within the examined population.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Data Overview</h2>
                  <p><strong>Dataset Composition:</strong></p> 
                  <p><strong>Account Information:</strong> 1,000 records with financial metrics</p> 
                  <p><strong>Account Holder Information:</strong> 1,045 records (45 duplicates removed)</p>
                  <p><strong>Fraud Indicators:</strong> 1,000 records with mule account flags</p>
                  <p><strong>Total Mule Accounts Identified:</strong> 59</p>
                  
                  <h2>Key Findings</h2>
                  <h2>Age-Based Patterns</h2>
                  <p>The analysis reveals a concerning trend where mule account activity increases with age. The 46-60 age group represents the highest risk segment with 19 mule accounts (32.2% of total), followed by the 36-45 age group with 13 mule accounts (22.0% of total). The 25-35 age group had 10 mule accounts (16.9% of total), while both the 18-24 and 60+ age groups each had 8 mule accounts (13.6% each). Notably, the 0-17 age group had no mule accounts detected.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Gender Distribution</h2>
                  <p>Male account holders show slightly higher involvement in mule activities with 30 mule accounts (50.8% of total), compared to 26 mule accounts (44.1% of total) for females. There were 3 mule accounts (5.1% of total) with missing gender data.</p>
                  
                  <h2>High-Risk Profile Combinations</h2>
                  <p>The analysis identified specific demographic combinations with elevated mule account concentrations. The highest risk profiles are 46-60 Female with 11 accounts (18.6% of all mule accounts) and 36-45 Male with 11 accounts (18.6% of all mule accounts). Other notable combinations include 60+ Female with 6 accounts (10.2% of all mule accounts), 25-35 Male with 6 accounts (10.2% of all mule accounts), and 18-24 Male with 5 accounts (8.5% of all mule accounts).</p>
                  
                  <h2>Analysis and Interpretation of Findings</h2>
                  <h2>Understanding the Age Distribution Pattern</h2>
                  <p>The concentration of mule accounts in older age groups (36-60) likely reflects several societal and technological factors. There is a significant digital literacy gap where older generations typically have less exposure to online safety education and may be less familiar with evolving fraud tactics. Unlike younger individuals who grew up with the internet, middle-aged adults often learned to use digital banking later in life, potentially making them more susceptible to sophisticated social engineering attacks.</p>
                  <p>Younger generations (18-35) benefit from school-based education where modern curriculums increasingly include digital literacy and financial security awareness. They also have social media awareness through constant exposure to online scams and fraud warnings through social platforms, active peer networks that share fraud alerts and safety tips within digitally native communities, and higher engagement with online news sources that frequently cover cybersecurity threats.</p>
                  <p>Vulnerability factors for older adults include being less likely to verify suspicious requests through multiple channels, placing higher trust in authority figures or official-sounding communications, often having established banking relationships that fraudsters can exploit through impersonation, and being less aware of red flags in digital communications.</p>
                  <p>The 36-60 age group often faces significant financial pressures including mortgages, children's education costs, and retirement planning that may make them more susceptible to promises of easy income through "money transfer services."</p>
                  
                  <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>
                  <h2>Critical Observations</h2>
                  <p><strong>Age Vulnerability:</strong> Middle-aged individuals (36-60) represent 54.2% of all mule accounts, suggesting this demographic may be more susceptible to recruitment or coercion</p>
                  <p><strong>Gender Parity:</strong> The relatively balanced distribution between male and female account holders indicates that mule account schemes target both genders equally</p>
                  <p><strong>Data Quality:</strong> The presence of 45 duplicate records in account holder data and missing gender information for some accounts highlights the need for improved data collection processes.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                  <h2>Immediate Actions</h2>
                  <p><strong>Enhanced Monitoring:</strong> Implement heightened surveillance for accounts held by individuals aged 36-60, particularly focusing on the identified high-risk combinations</p>
                  <p><strong>Targeted Outreach:</strong> Develop educational campaigns specifically targeting middle-aged account holders about mule account schemes and their consequences</p>
                  <p><strong>Data Quality Improvement:</strong> Address duplicate records and missing demographic information to enhance future analysis accuracy.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Strategic Initiatives</h2>
                  <p><strong>Risk Scoring Model:</strong> Develop a comprehensive risk scoring system incorporating age and gender factors alongside existing financial behavior metrics</p>
                  <p><strong>Behavioral Analysis:</strong> Expand analysis to include transaction patterns, account usage frequency, and other behavioral indicators that may correlate with mule account activity</p>
                  <p><strong>Regular Review:</strong> Establish quarterly reviews of demographic trends to identify emerging patterns and adjust monitoring strategies accordingly.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Limitations</h2>
                  <p>- Analysis is based on demographic factors only and does not include behavioral or transactional patterns</p>
                  <p>- Data quality issues (duplicates, missing values) may impact accuracy.</p>
                  <p>- Sample size of 1,000 accounts may not be fully representative of the broader customer base.</p>
                  
                  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                  <p>The analysis reveals clear demographic patterns in mule account activity, with middle-aged individuals showing disproportionate involvement due to a confluence of technological, educational, and social factors. The data suggests that digital literacy and early exposure to fraud prevention education serve as protective factors, while the transition generation (those who adopted digital banking as adults) remains more vulnerable. This understanding provides valuable insight for developing age-appropriate prevention strategies and educational interventions.</p>

Users can select any of the 24 races from the season and dive deep into the story of that particular Grand Prix through real telemetry data, lap times, and championship standings.</p>
                    
                    <p>The application offers four key analysis perspectives:</p>
                    <p>- Lap-by-lap position tracking that shows how drivers progressed throughout the race</p>
                    <p>- Championship impact analysis revealing points earned and performance changes</p>
                    <p>- Comprehensive performance dashboards displaying race context alongside championship standings</p>
                    <p>- Detailed results tables with timing data, sector splits, and race status information</p>
                    
                    <p>What sets this apart from typical data visualization tools is its integration with real Formula 1 data through the FastF1 library. Every chart and statistic reflects actual race telemetry rather than simulated information. The interface presents all 24 races as selectable chapters, with special highlighting for championship-defining moments like Max Verstappen's legendary Brazil drive from 17th to 1st position. Users select which drivers to analyse from the full 2024 grid, then generate interactive charts that tell the story of each race through data.</p>
                    
                    <h2>The Traditional Learning Approach VS AI Mentorship</h2>
                    <p>Like many aspiring developers, I initially turned to the usual suspects for learning Python data analysis: LinkedIn Learning courses and YouTube tutorials. However, I quickly discovered that these resources weren't suited to my learning style. I learn best by doing, by working through problems hands-on rather than passively watching someone else code. The generic datasets and abstract examples in these courses felt disconnected from anything I cared about, making it difficult to stay engaged and retain what I was learning.</p>
                    <p>The breakthrough came when I realized I needed a more structured, personalized approach. I turned to Claude AI to create a custom learning pathway that would simulate the kind of classroom experience I had thrived in during secondary school and college. This wasn't about getting quick answers to coding problems, but about creating a systematic curriculum that would take me from complete beginner to building a sophisticated application.</p>
                    <p>Working with ClaudeAI, I developed a lesson-by-lesson approach that followed a similar structure to that I had experienced in academia. Each lesson would start with a clear explanation of a core concept using simple, non-F1 examples to establish the fundamentals. Once I grasped the basic principle, Claude would then show me how to apply that same concept specifically to Formula 1 data analysis, connecting abstract programming concepts to something I was genuinely passionate about.</p>
                    <p>This approach proved transformative. Instead of struggling through generic pandas tutorials about apple and banana sales, I was learning data manipulation through the lens of lap times, championship standings, and driver performance. The learning became immediately relevant and engaging because every technique I mastered brought me closer to building an incredible program with real world applications.</p>

                    <h2>Technical Architecture and Data Analysis Capabilities</h2>
                    <p>The systematic learning approach naturally led to a well-structured application design. The core architecture consists of two main components that work in harmony to deliver the user experience.</p>
                    <h2>F1ChampionshipStoryEngine - Data Analysis Core</h2>
                    <p>The F1ChampionshipStoryEngine serves as the data analysis backbone, handling all FastF1 operations including session management, real-time data loading for all 24 races, multiple chart generation methods, and progressive championship standings tracking. This engine processes everything from lap-by-lap position changes to constructor performance analysis.</p>
                    <p>The data processing capabilities include:</p>
                    <p>- Progressive championship standings for both drivers and constructors after each race</p>
                    <p>- Intelligent handling of race retirements, penalties, and data inconsistencies</p>
                    <p>- Memory-efficient caching strategies for telemetry data from 24 complete race weekends</p>
                    <p>- Best race lap and best sector identification</p>
                    
                    <h2>F1RaceChapterNavigator - User Interface Layer</h2>
                    <p>The F1RaceChapterNavigator provides the user interface layer, featuring a scrollable race selection interface that presents all 24 races as interactive chapters. Users can dynamically select which drivers to analyze through team-colored checkboxes, view embedded matplotlib charts in separate windows, and receive clear status indicators during data loading operations. The interface also highlights championship-defining races like Lando Norris's breakthrough win in Miami and Max Verstappen's legendary Brazil drive from P17 to P1.</p>

                    <h2>Advanced Visualization Capabilities</h2>
                    <p>The application generates four distinct types of data visualizations:</p>
                    <p><strong>Position Progression Charts </strong>track each driver's position throughout the race, incorporating starting grid positions and handling retirements. The charts use team colors and distinct markers to differentiate drivers, with championship zones highlighted to show podium and points-paying positions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Championship Impact Analysis </strong>displays points earned in each race alongside grid vs final position comparisons, revealing which drivers gained or lost positions from their starting positions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Performance Dashboards </strong>combine multiple data perspectives in a single view: position progression, constructor championship standings after the selected race, position changes analysis, and driver championship standings for selected drivers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Detailed Results Tables </strong>provide comprehensive race data including gap calculations to the race leader, best lap times, sector analysis, average speeds, and race status information, with color-coding for podium finishers and points-scoring positions.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Real-World Data Integration Challenges</h2>
                    <p>Working with real Formula 1 data introduced complexities that no generic tutorial could have prepared me for. The FastF1 library provides access to actual telemetry data, but Formula 1 races are dynamic events where drivers retire mid-race, penalties are applied, and unusual circumstances create edge cases in the data.</p>
                    <p>The application handles varying session lengths, data inconsistencies, and the sheer volume of information generated by a single Grand Prix weekend. Memory management became a significant concern when dealing with telemetry data from 24 complete race weekends, leading to the implementation of intelligent caching strategies and on-demand data loading.</p>
                    <p>User experience considerations drove additional technical refinements. Data loading from the FastF1 API can take considerable time, especially for first-time requests. Implementing proper status indicators and error handling became essential to maintain a professional user experience.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Reflection: The Power of Context-Driven Learning</h2>
                    <p>The success of this approach highlights the importance of learning programming in context rather than in abstract isolation. Every pandas operation, every matplotlib chart, and every tkinter component served a specific purpose in telling the story of the 2024 Formula 1 season. This connection between technique and purpose made complex concepts more memorable and immediately applicable.</p>
                    <p>The structured lesson progression provided a clear sense of advancement and achievement. Each completed lesson brought tangible progress toward the ultimate goal of building a comprehensive season explorer. This contrasted sharply with the frustration of working through generic tutorials where the connection between individual exercises and real-world applications remained unclear.</p>
                    <p>Working with Claude to develop this curriculum also meant I could adapt the learning path in real-time based on my progress and interests. When certain concepts proved challenging, we could spend additional time on foundational work. When I grasped something quickly, we could accelerate to more advanced topics. This flexibility is difficult to achieve with pre-recorded courses or static tutorials.</p>
                    <p>This project demonstrates the potential for AI-assisted education to recreate the benefits of personalised instruction. By using AI not as a source of quick answers, but as a partner in designing and executing a comprehensive educational experience, I was able to achieve learning outcomes that traditional online resources hadn't delivered. The approach suggests that the future of technical education might involve more collaboration between human learners and AI systems to create customised learning pathways that connect technical skills to personal interests and goals.</p>
